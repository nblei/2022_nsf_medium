Dr. Kumar has served as PI on the following NSF-funded project in
the last five years: CCF-2006763 SHF (from 2020-2023 \$500K).

CCF-2006763 SHF Printed Computer Systems (\$500K, October 2020- September
2023). Intellectual Merit: The project has already resulted in first sub-cent
microprocessor~cite{bleier22}, first plastic encryption
engines~\cite{bleier23}, first work on printed
microprocessors~\cite{bleier2020printed}, and first work on printed
classifiers~\cite{mubarik20}. Broader Impact: This project has opened up new
possibilities for ultra-low cost and conformal active electronics, enabling
applications such as wearable patches~\cite{8502791},
garments~\cite{garments},
packaging~\cite{gethin2013printed} for fast
moving consumer goods (FMCG), low-end healthcare products such as smart
bandages~\cite{DERAKHSHANDEH20181259},
and disposable sensors for food~\cite{7994325},
pharmaceuticals~\cite{BERGAMINI200554},
agriculture and forestry~\cite{chemosensors8040125},
and environment~\cite{MARRAZZA1999297} --- that have not seen much
penetration of computing.
