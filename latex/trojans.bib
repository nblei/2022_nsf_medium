Due to the globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing industry, hardware Trojans constitute an increasingly probable threat to both commercial and military applications. With traditional testing methods falling short in the quest of finding hardware Trojans, several specialized detection methods have surfaced. To facilitate research in this area, a better understanding of what Hardware Trojans would look like and what impact they would incur to an IC is required. To this end, we present eight distinct attack techniques employing Register Transfer Level (RTL) hardware Trojans to compromise the security of an Alpha encryption module implemented on a Digilent BASYS Spartan-3 FPGA board. Our work, which earned second place in the aforementioned competition, demonstrates that current RTL designs are, indeed, quite vulnerable to hardware Trojan attacks.},

 abstract={We present a silicon implementation of a hardware Trojan, which is capable of leaking the secret key of a wireless cryptographic integrated circuit (IC) consisting of an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core and an Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) transmitter. With its impact carefully hidden in the transmission specification margins allowed for process variations, this hardware Trojan cannot be detected by production testing methods of either the digital or the analog part of the IC and does not violate the transmission protocol or any system-level specifications. Nevertheless, the informed adversary, who knows what to look for in the transmission power waveform, is capable of retrieving the 128-bit AES key, which is leaked with every 128-bit ciphertext block sent by the UWB transmitter. Using silicon measurements from 40 chips fabricated in TSMC's 0.35�m technology, we also assess the effectiveness of a side channel-based statistical analysis method in detecting this hardware Trojan.}

As the complexity and size of SoCs continues to grow, so does the risk of ��Trojan�� attacks, in which an integrated circuit (IC) design is surreptitiously and maliciously altered at some point during the design or manufacturing process. Despite the risks that such an attack entail, relatively little attention has been given in the literature to methods enabling detection of and response to run-time Trojan attacks. In the present paper, we present a Trojan-resistant system bus architecture suitable across a wide range of SoC bus systems. The system detects malicious bus behaviors associated Trojan hardware, protects the system and system bus from them and reports the malicious behaviors to the CPU. We show that use of this bus and associated embedded software is highly effective in reducing IC Trojan vulnerabilities without loss of bus performance.},

abstract={We exploit transient and permanent error control methods to address Hardware Trojan (HT) issues in Network-on-Chip (NoC) links. The use of hardware-efficient error control methods on NoC links has the potential to reduce the overall hardware cost for security protection, with respect to cryptographic-based rerouting algorithms. An error control coding method for transient errors is used to detect the HT-induced link errors. Regarding the faulty links as permanently failed interconnects, we propose to reshuffle the links and isolate the HT-controlled link wires. Rather than rerouting packets via alternative paths, the proposed method resumes the utilization of partially failed links to improve the bandwidth and the average latency of NoCs. Simulation results show that our method improves the average latency by up to 44.7% over the rerouting approach. The reduction on latency varies from 20% to 41% for three traffic patterns on a 5�5 mesh NoC. The impact of different HT locations on NoC links was examined, as well. Our method is not sensitive to HT locations and can improve the effective bandwidth by up to 29 bits per cycle with minor overhead.},

abstract={Current research into Trojan detection suggests that exhaustive Trojan detection in a chip during limited manufacturing test time is an extremely difficult problem. Indeed, an especially nefarious form of Trojan known as the time bomb has a payload activated in a delayed manner making it extremely hard to detect. As a result, chip trust detection at manufacturing test time may not be adequate especially for critical applications. This suggests that some form of dynamic trust detection of the chip both preliminary (possibly during a preproduction phase) and during in-field use at run time is required. We explore an approach to this problem that combines multicore hardware with dynamic distributed software scheduling to determine hardware trust during in-field use at run time. Our approach involves the scheduling and execution of functionally equivalent variants (obtained by different compilations, or different algorithm variations) simultaneously on different PEs and comparing the results. The process dynamically achieves trust determination by identifying the existence of Trojans with a high level of confidence.},

 abstract={This paper gives an overview of the place of reverse engineering (RE) in the semiconductor industry, and the techniques used to obtain information from semiconductor products.
The continuous drive of Moore's law to increase the integration level of silicon chips has presented major challenges to the reverse engineer, obsolescing simple teardowns, and demanding the adoption of new and more sophisticated technology to analyse chips. Hardware encryption embedded in chips adds a whole other level of difficulty to IC analysis.
This paper covers product teardowns, and discusses the techniques used for system-level analysis, both hardware and software; circuit extraction, taking the chip down to the transistor level, and working back up through the interconnects to create schematics; and process analysis, looking at how a chip is made, and what it is made of. Examples are also given of each type of RE. The paper concludes with a case study of the analysis of an IC with embedded encryption hardware.}

This paper presents a hybrid hardware/software approach to defending against malicious hardware. We propose BlueChip, a defensive strategy that has both a design-time component and a runtime component. During the design verification phase, BlueChip invokes a new technique, unused circuit identification (UCI), to identify suspicious circuitry�those circuits not used or otherwise activated by any of the design verification tests. BlueChip removes the suspicious circuitry and replaces it with exception generation hardware. The exception handler software is responsible for providing forward progress by emulating the effect of the exception generating instruction in software, effectively providing a detour around suspicious hardware. In our experiments, BlueChip is able to prevent all hardware attacks we evaluate while incurring a small runtime overhead.},

abstract={Hardware Trojans (HTs) implemented by adversaries serve as backdoors to subvert or augment the normal operation of infected devices, which may lead to functionality changes, sensitive information leakages, or Denial of Service attacks. To tackle such threats, this paper proposes a novel verification technique for hardware trust, namely VeriTrust, which facilitates to detect HTs inserted at design stage. Based on the observation that HTs are usually activated by dedicated trigger inputs that are not sensitized with verification test cases, VeriTrust automatically identifies such potential HT trigger inputs by examining verification corners. The key difference between VeriTrust and existing HT detection techniques is that VeriTrust is insensitive to the implementation style of HTs. Experimental results show that VeriTrust is able to detect all HTs evaluated in this paper (constructed based on various HT design methodologies shown in the literature) at the cost of moderate extra verification time, which is not possible with existing solutions.},

 abstract={Hardware design today bears similarities to software design. Often vendors buy and integrate code acquired from third-party organizations into their designs, especially in embedded/system-on-chip designs. Currently, there is no way to determine if third-party designs have built-in backdoors that can compromise security after deployment.
The key observation we use to approach this problem is that hardware backdoors incorporate logic that is nearly-unused, i.e. stealthy. The wires used in stealthy backdoor circuits almost never influence the outputs of those circuits. Typically, they do so only when triggered using external inputs from an attacker. In this paper, we present FANCI, a tool that flags suspicious wires, in a design, which have the potential to be malicious. FANCI uses scalable, approximate, boolean functional analysis to detect these wires.
Our examination of the TrustHub hardware backdoor benchmark suite shows that FANCI is able to flag all suspicious paths in the benchmarks that are associated with backdoors. Unlike prior work in the area, FANCI is not hindered by incomplete test suite coverage and thus is able to operate in practice without false negatives. Furthermore, FANCI reports low false positive rates: less than 1% of wires are reported as suspicious in most cases. All TrustHub designs were analyzed in a day or less. We also analyze a backdoor-free out-of-order microprocessor core to demonstrate applicability beyond benchmarks.}

The UCI algorithm essentially looks for portions of the circuit that go unused during design-time testing and flags them as potentially malicious. In this paper we construct circuits that have malicious behavior, but that would evade detection by the UCI algorithm and still pass design-time test cases. To enable our search for such circuits, we define one class of malicious circuits and perform a bounded exhaustive enumeration of all circuits in that class. Our approach is simple and straight forward, yet it proves to be effective at finding circuits that can thwart UCI. We use the results of our search to construct a practical attack on an open-source processor. Our malicious backdoor allows any user-level program running on the processor to enter supervisor mode through the use of a secret a^ knock. We close with a discussion on what we see as a major challenge facing any future design-time malicious hardware detection scheme: identifying a sufficient class of malicious circuits to defend against.},

 abstract={Hardware Trojans (HTs) inserted at design time by malicious insiders on the design team or third-party intellectual property (IP) providers pose a serious threat to the security of computing systems. Researchers have proposed several hardware trust verification techniques to mitigate such threats, and some of them are shown to be able to effectively flag all suspicious HTs implemented in the Trust-Hub hardware backdoor benchmark suite. No doubt to say, adversaries would adjust their tactics of attacks accordingly and it is hence essential to examine whether new types of HTs can be designed to defeat these hardware trust verification techniques. In this paper, we present a systematic HT design methodology to achieve the above objective, namely \emph{DeTrust}. Given an HT design, DeTrust keeps its original malicious behavior while making the HT resistant to state-of-the-art hardware trust verification techniques by manipulating its trigger designs. To be specific, DeTrust implements stealthy implicit triggers for HTs by carefully spreading the trigger logic into multiple sequential levels and combinational logic blocks and combining the trigger logic with the normal logic, so that they are not easily differentiable from normal logic. As shown in our experimental results, adversaries can easily employ DeTrust to evade hardware trust verification.
We close with a discussion on how to extend existing solutions to alleviate the threat posed by DeTrust. However, they generally suffer from high computational complexity, calling for more advanced techniques to ensure hardware trust.}

pages={107-112},
abstract={There have been a number of hardware Trojan (HT) designs at register-transfer level (RTL) in the literature, which mainly describe their malicious behaviors and trigger mechanisms. Generally speaking, the stealthiness of the HTs is shown with extremely low sensitization probability of the trigger events. In practice, however, based on the fact that HTs are not sensitized with verification test cases (otherwise their malicious behaviors would have manifested themselves), designers could focus on verification corners for HT detection. Consequently, a stealthy HT not only requires to be hard to trigger, but also needs to be able to evade those hardware trust verification techniques based on �unused circuit identification (UCI)�. In this paper, we present new HT design and implementation techniques that are able to achieve the above objectives. In addition, attackers would like to be able to control their HTs easily, which is also considered in the proposed HT design methodology. Experimental results demonstrate that HTs constructed with the proposed technique are both hard to be detected and easy to be controlled when compared to existing HTs shown in the literature.},

year={2008},
pages={117-124},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a randomization based technique to verify whether a manufactured chip conforms to its design or is infected by any trojan circuit. A trojan circuit can be inserted into the design or fabrication mask by a malicious manufacturer such that it monitors for a specific rare trigger condition, and then it produces a payload error in the circuit which alters the functionality of the circuit often causing a catastrophic crash of the system where the chip was being used. Since trojans are activated by rare input patterns, they are stealthy by nature and are difficult to detect through conventional techniques of functional testing. In this paper, we propose a novel randomized approach to probabilistically compare the functionality of the implemented circuit with the design of the circuit. Using hypothesis testing, we provide quantitative guarantees when our algorithm reports that there is no trojan in the implemented circuit. This allows us to trade runtime for accuracy. The technique is sound, that is, it reports presence of a trojan only if the implemented circuit is actually infected. If our algorithm finds that the implemented circuit is infected with a trojan, it also reports a fingerprint input pattern to distinguish the implemented circuit from the design. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique on a set of infected and benign combinational circuits.},

abstract={Fabless semiconductor industry and government agencies have raised serious concerns about tampering with inserting hardware Trojans in an integrated circuit supply chain in recent years. Most of the recently proposed Trojan detection methods are based on Trojan activation to observe either a faulty output or measurable abnormality on side-channel signals. Time to activate a hardware Trojan circuit is a major concern from the authentication standpoint. This paper analyzes time to generate a transition in functional Trojans. Transition is modeled by geometric distribution and the number of clock cycles required to generate a transition is estimated. Furthermore, a dummy scan flip-flop insertion procedure is proposed aiming at decreasing transition generation time. The procedure increases transition probabilities of nets beyond a specific threshold. The relation between circuit topology, authentication time, and the threshold is carefully studied. The simulation results on s38417 benchmark circuit demonstrate that, with a negligible area overhead, our proposed method can significantly increase Trojan activity and reduce Trojan activation time.},

pages={296-310},
abstract={Hardware manufacturers are increasingly outsourcing their IC fabrication work overseas due to their much lower cost structure. This poses a significant security risk for ICs used for critical military and business applications. Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.},

The migration of IC fabrication to untrusted foundries has made ICs vulnerable to malicious alterations, that could, under specific conditions, result infunctional changes and/or catastrophic failure of the system in which they are embedded.

In this paper, we propose a current integration methodology to observe Trojan activity in the circuit and a localized current analysis approach to isolate the Trojan.

abstract={The use of side-channel parametric measurements along with statistical analysis methods for detecting hardware Trojans in fabricated integrated circuits has been studied extensively in recent years, initially for digital designs but recently also for their analog/RF counterparts. Such post-fabrication trust evaluation methods, however, are unable to detect dormant hardware Trojans which are activated after a circuit is deployed in its field of operation. For the latter, an on-chip trust evaluation method is required. To this end, we present a general architecture for post-deployment trust evaluation based on on-chip classifiers. Specifically, we discuss the design of an on-chip analog neural network which can be trained to distinguish trusted from untrusted circuit functionality based on simple measurements obtained via on-chip measurement acquisition sensors. The proposed method is demonstrated using a Trojan-free and two Trojan infested variants of a wireless cryptographic IC design, as well as a fabricated programmable neural network experimentation chip. As corroborated by the obtained experimental results, two current measurements suffice for the on-chip classifier to effectively assess trustworthiness and, thereby, detect hardware Trojans that are activated after chip deployment.},

abstract={Malicious modification of integrated circuits, referred to as Hardware Trojans, in untrusted fabrication facility has emerged as a major security threat. Logic testing approaches are not very effective for detecting large sequential Trojans which require multiple state transitions often triggered by rare circuit events in order to activate and cause malfunction. On the other hand, side-channel analysis has emerged as an effective approach for detection of such large sequential Trojans. However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from large reduction in detection sensitivity with increasing process variations or decreasing Trojan size. In this paper, we propose TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to completely eliminate the effect of process noise, thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike existing approaches, it does not require golden chip instances as a reference. Simulation results for three complex designs and three representative sequential Trojan circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach under large inter- and intra-die process variations.},

The automatic test platform is set up with Xilinx FPGA, LabVIEW software, and high precision oscilloscope. The power trace of the core power supply in FPGA is monitored and saved for frequency spectrum analysis. Experimental results in time domain and frequency domain both accord with those of theoretical analysis, which verifies that the proposed failure physics model is accurate. In addition, due to immunity to vast measurement noise, the novel method processing in frequency domain is superior to the traditional method conducting in time domain. It can easily achieve about 0.1% Trojan detection sensitivity, which indicates that the novel detection method is effective.},

In this paper, we present new accurate methods for Trojan detection that are based upon post-silicon multimodal thermal and power characterization techniques. Our approach first estimates the detailed post-silicon spatial power consumption using thermal maps of the IC, then applies 2DPCA to extract features of the spatial power consumption, and finally uses statistical tests against the features of authentic ICs to detect the Trojan. To characterize real-world ICs accurately, we perform our experiments in presence of 20% � 40% CMOS process variation.

abstract={Hardware Trojans are malicious alterations or injections of unwanted circuitry to integrated circuits (ICs) by untrustworthy factories. They render great threat to the security of modern ICs by various unwanted activities such as bypassing or disabling the security fence of a system, leaking confidential information, deranging, or destroying the entire chip. Traditional testing strategies are becoming ineffective since these techniques suffer from decreased sensitivity toward small Trojans because of oversized chip and large amount of process variation present in nanometer technologies. The production volume along with decreased controllability and observability to complex ICs internals make it difficult to efficiently perform Trojan detection using typical structural tests like path latency and leakage power. In this paper, we propose a completely new post-silicon multimodal approach using runtime thermal and power maps for Trojan detection and localization. Utilizing the novel framework, we propose two different Trojan detection methods involving 2-D principal component analysis. First, supervised thresholding in case training data set is available and second, unsupervised clustering which require no prior characterization data of the chip. We introduce 11 regularization in the thermal to power inversion procedure which improves Trojan detection accuracy. To characterize ICs accurately, we perform our experiments in presence of realistic CMOS process variation. Our experimental evaluations reveal that our proposed methodology can detect very small Trojans with 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller power consumptions than the total power usage of the chip, while it scales very well because of the spatial view to ICs internals by the thermal mapping.},

abstract="Hardware trojans inserted in integrated circuits have received special attention of researchers. Most of the recent researches focus on detecting the presence of hardware trojans through various techniques like reverse engineering, test/verification methods and side-channel analysis (SCA). Previous works using SCA for trojan detection are based on power measurements, or even simulations. When using real silicon, the results are strongly biased by the process variations, the exact size of the trojan, and its location. In this paper, we propose a metric to measure the impact of these parameters. For the first time, we give the detection probability of a trojan as a function of its activity, even if untriggered. Moreover, we use electromagnetic field as side-channel, as it provides a better spatial and temporal resolution than power measurements. We conduct a proof of concept study using an AES-128 cryptographic core running on a set of 10 Virtex-5 FPGA. Our results show that, using this metric, there is a probability superior than 99 {\%} with a false negative rate of 0.017 {\%} to detect a HT bigger than 1 {\%} of the original circuit.",

In contrast to most previous work, we do not evaluate our proposal using simulations but we rather conduct experiments with an FPGA. We investigate the effectiveness of our technique in detecting extremely small Hardware Trojans located at different positions within the FPGA. In addition, we also study its robustness to the often neglected issue of variations in the test environment. The results show that our method is able to detect most of our test Hardware Trojans but also highlight the difficulty of measuring emanations of unrealistically tiny Hardware Trojans. The results also confirm that our method is sensitive to changes in the test environment.},

abstract={New attacker scenarios involving integrated circuits (ICs) are emerging that pose a tremendous threat to national security. Concerns about overseas fabrication facilities and the protection of deployed ICs have given rise to methods for IC authentication (ensuring that an IC being used in a system has not been altered, replaced, or spoofed) and hardware Trojan Horse (HTH) detection (ensuring that an IC fabricated in a nonsecure facility contains the desired functionality and nothing more), but significant additional work is required to quell these treats. This paper discusses how a technique for precisely measuring the combinational delay of an arbitrarily large number of register-to-register paths internal to the functional portion of the IC can be used to provide the desired authentication and design alteration (including HTH implantation) detection. This low-cost delay measurement technique does not affect the main IC functionality and can be performed at-speed at both test-time and run-time.},

abstract={Trusted IC design is a recently emerged topic since fabrication factories are moving worldwide in order to reduce cost. In order to get a low-cost but effective hardware trojan detection method to complement traditional testing methods, a new behavior-oriented category method is proposed to divide trojans into two categories: explicit payload trojan and implicit payload trojan. This categorization method makes it possible to construct trojan models and then lower the cost of testing. Path delays of nominal chips are collected to construct a series of fingerprints, each one representing one aspect of the total characteristics of a genuine design. Chips are validated by comparing their delay parameters to the fingerprints. The comparison of path delays makes small trojan circuits significant from a delay point of view. The experimentpsilas results show that the detection rate on explicit payload trojans is 100%, while this method should be developed further if used to detect implicit payload trojans.},

abstract={The horizontal dissemination of the chip fabrication industry has raised new concerns over Integrated Circuit (IC) Trust, in particular, the threat of malicious functionality, i.e., a Hardware Trojan, that is added by an adversary to an IC. In this paper, we propose the use of a high-precision, low-overhead embedded test structure for measuring path delays to detect the delay anomalies introduced by hardware Trojans. The proposed test structure, called REBEL, is minimally invasive to the design as it leverages the existing scan structures. In this work, we integrate REBEL into a structural description of a pipelined Floating Point Unit. Trojan emulation circuits, designed to model internal wire loads introduced by a hardware Trojan, are inserted into the design at multiple places. The emulation cell incorporates an analog control pin to allow a variety of hardware Trojan loading scenarios to be investigated. We evaluate the detection sensitivity of REBEL for detecting hardware Trojans using regression analysis and hardware data collected from 62 copies of the chip fabricated in 90nm CMOS technology.},

Our method focuses on various sources of process variations and significantly reduces the effects of variations on delays by calibrating delays measured on each fabricated chip. Using test structures and additional measurements on these, our approach significantly reduces the number of chips that we need to test to detect minimally-invasive Trojans with a desired level of confidence. Our approach for tackling high levels of process variations can be used in conjunction with any other type of parametric Trojan detection strategy to significantly improve its efficiency.},

year={2013},
pages={1265-1270},
abstract={One of the growing issues in IC design is how to establish trustworthiness of chips fabricated by untrusted vendors. Such process, often called Trojan detection, is challenging since the specifics of hardware Trojans inserted by intelligent adversaries are difficult to predict and most Trojans do not affect the logic behavior of the circuit unless they are activated. Also, Trojan detection via parametric measurements becomes increasingly difficult with increasing levels of process variations. In this paper we propose a method that maximizes the resolution of each path delay measurement, in terms of its ability to detect the targeted Trojan. In particular, for each Trojan, our approach accentuates the Trojan's impact by generating a vector that sensitizes the shortest path passing via the Trojan's site. We estimate the minimum number of chips to which each vector must be applied to detect the Trojan with sufficient confidence for a given level of process variations. Finally, we demonstrate the significant improvements in effectiveness and cost provided by our approach under high levels of process variations. Experimental results on several benchmark circuits show that we can achieve dramatic reduction in test cost using our approach compared to classical path delay testing.},

abstract={Hardware Trojan horses (HTHs) are the malicious altering of hardware specification or implementation in such a way that its functionality is altered under a set of conditions defined by the attacker. There are numerous HTHs sources including untrusted foundries, synthesis tools and libraries, testing and verification tools, and configuration scripts. HTH attacks can greatly comprise security and privacy of hardware users either directly or through interaction with pertinent systems and application software or with data. However, while there has been a huge research and development effort for detecting software Trojan horses, surprisingly, HTHs are rarely addressed. HTH detection is a particularly difficult task in modern and pending deep submicron technologies due to intrinsic manufacturing variability. Our goal is to provide an impetus for HTH research by creating a generic and easily applicable set of techniques and tools for HTH detection. We start by introducing a technique for recovery of characteristics of gates in terms of leakage current, switching power, and delay, which utilizes linear programming to solve a system of equations created using nondestructive measurements of power or delays. This technique is combined with constraint manipulation techniques to detect embedded HTHs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of standard benchmarks.},
