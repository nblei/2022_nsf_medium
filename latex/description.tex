{\Large \textbf{SHF:Medium:Making Analog Side Channels a First-Class Consideration in Architecture-Level Design}}
\end{center}

\section{Introduction}
Analog side-channels (power, electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) have long been a potential source of attacks that circumvent traditional protections and security measures~\cite{217605,Backes:2010:ASA:1929820.1929847,Balasch2015DPABA,10.1007/978-3-319-66787-4_27,4812164,Chari:2002:TA:648255.752740,Genkin:2016:EKE:2976749.2978353}. This is especially a problem for cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, which are often placed in publicly accessible locations
and yet contain sensitive data, such as sensor data, login information for over-the-network management of the system and/or accessing back-end cloud infrastructure.
For some side-channels, such as electromagnetic (EM) emanations, physical proximity can be leveraged to attack systems that are considered to be physically secure but are located {\em near} publicly accessible locations, e.g., in-wall ``smart building'' sensors, security cameras, etc~\cite{10.1007/978-3-662-48324-4_11,6766222,Camurati:2018:SCE:3243734.3243802,8574570}.
Many such attacks have been demonstrated over the past several decades, followed by countermeasures that prevent specific attacks by modifying the software that has been demonstrated to leak sensitive information. However, recent analog side channel attacks demonstrated by PIs Prvulovic and Zajic have shown that both attacks and mitigation are becoming increasingly dependent on microarchitectural behavior, making mitigation potentially fragile to future microarchitectural changes~\cite{217605,Monjur21}.
Unfortunately, early-design tools, such as cycle-accurate (microarchitecture-level) simulators~\cite{Li:2009:MIP:1669112.1669172,Li:2011:CAM:2132325.2132479,509850,Ardestani:2013:EFM:2495252.2495480,Binkert:2011:GS:2024716.2024718,sesc,5982026,carlson2014aeohmcm}, do not model analog side channel signals, so these side channels can only be considered when they can be physically measured (post-fabrivation). At that time, however, time-to-market concerns prevent introduction of overall design changes that would adjust the design tradeoffs in a more desirable direction. Additionally, most software developers have neither the know-how nor the equipment to assess their software’s potential vulnerability to analog side channels, so such considerations are typically either qualitative or entirely absent during software design, giving first-mover advantage to attackers, and resulting in mitigation via localized patches, which themselves are becoming increasingly microarchitecture-dependent.

Ideally,information leakage through analog side channels, and potential for ``breaking'' existing software mitigation approaches, would be considered in early stages of design for both hardware and software, guided by tools that can predict the impact a specific design has on analog side channels. This would be analogous to how performance and power consumption are predicted by cycle-accurate simulators, which allows the tradeoff between performance, power, and cost to be investigated at design time, years before the first prototypes are fabricated ~\cite{Li:2009:MIP:1669112.1669172,Li:2011:CAM:2132325.2132479,509850,Ardestani:2013:EFM:2495252.2495480,Binkert:2011:GS:2024716.2024718,sesc,5982026,carlson2014aeohmcm} If such efficient-yet-highly-accurate simulation would exist for analog side channels, computer architects could include analog side-channel leakage among their design considerations~\cite{8416860,Althoff:2018:HII:3276539.3276601,Andrysco:2018:TVC:3243734.3243766,cryptoeprint:2018:808,Rane:2016:SPF:3241094.3241101,nayak2017hop}, compilers could use simulation models to optimize for reduced leakage~\cite{Liu:2015:GHS:2694344.2694385,Rane:2015:RCD:2831143.2831171,Gorman:2017:AON:3123939.3123973}, software designers could detect and mitigate information leakage problems for security-sensitive applications~\cite{Wichelmann:2018:MFF:3274694.3274741,Chen:2017:PDS:3133956.3134058,Wu:2018:ETS:3213846.3213851}, etc.

While there are some tools and metrics to quantify analog side-channel leakage~\cite{Demme:2013:FOM:2485922.2485970,Callan:2014:PMM:2742155.2742179,McCann:2017:TPT:3241189.3241207,Barenghi:2018:SSS:3195970.3196112, yilmaz17tifs}, they are limited in several ways: \textit{First}, they are mainly focused on developing metrics to estimate the information leakage itself, i.e., mutual information between the signal and the program secrets, rather than modeling the actual analog signal. However, these metrics have inherent assumptions about the aspects of the signal the attacker may exploit, so they may not reveal \emph{all} of the information the signal may contain. \textit{Second}, most existing methods only model the system at the \textit{architecture} (ISA) level, associating a (leakage) value to individual instructions based on the ISA, while ignoring how the microarchitecture (pipeline stages, stall cycles, etc.) affects the signal. As we have demonstrated in our seminal paper on analog side channel modeling~\cite{Nader2020} (these findings will be briefly be summarized in Section~\ref{sec:proposed}), this can lead to significant inaccuracy. \textit{Third}, by neglecting the impact of micro-architecture, these methods implicitly assume that the entire hardware design is a \textit{single source} of the combined signal. Such an assumption can lead to large inaccuracies for some side channels (e.g. EM), because contributions of different microarchitectural blocks (e.g., cache, register-file, etc.) may experience different propagation (e.g. attenuation, low-pass filtering, etc.) to where the overall signal is being measured.

The PIs first attempt to address these challenges and develop microarchitecture-level analog side-channel model, was called EMSim~\cite{Nader2020}. That proof-of-concept study has shown that efficient, yet highly accurate, estimation of analog side channel signals is feasible, allowing modeling of numerous entire-program runs, e.g. to assess and improve leakage from a particular piece of code on a set of hardware platforms. EMSim was also the first model to asses leakage from a particular part of the system (when the goal is to make the design less ``leaky'') while maintaining the performance advantages of a cycle-accurate simulation relative to gate-level or physics-based models. However, while EMSim was good enough to demonstrate feasibility (and to serve as an excellent starting point for our proposed work, as will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:proposed}), it used a number of simplifications that limit its accuracy and its ability to model more complex processors.

\subsection{Summary of Proposed Research}
To address these issues and allow analog side channels to be treated as first-class design considerations, we propose to develop methods that would allow microarchitecture-level simulation to generate highly accurate analog side channel signals, even for sophisticated processors (deep pipelines, superscalar, out-of-order). Specifically, the proposed research has four main thrusts:

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item New methods that allow microarchitecture-level simulation to produce highly accurate analog side channel signals, along with per-block and per-code-region breakdowns/attribution to help computer architects and software developers assess how microarchitecture and software changes would affect the tradeoff between performance, power, and side-channel leakage. Our overall approach to this will be to combine per-event signal snippets into the overall side channel signal using event times from cycle-accurate simulation.
\item New methods for efficiently performing circuit-level simulation of caches, functional units, and other building blocks of the processor, to provide per-event timelines for voltage, current, and possibly other metrics that are needed to construct signal snippets for various side channels, along with other useful information such as how much the values of the metrics depend on data values.
\item New methods that produce per-event signal snippets for various side channels, by 1) transforming the outputs of circuit-level simulation, 2) decomposing measured signals, or 3) synergistically combining both methods. This thrust will also explore new methods that estimate per-block scaling factors for contributions of these snippets to the overall analog side channel signals.
\item New methods that validate simulated signals against measurements, and to adjust scaling factors, signal snippets, and the simulator's timing parameters to calibrate snippets, weights, and timing parameters to a real processor.
\end{enumerate}

 %If successful, our work will demonstrate the feasibility of modeling analog side-channels at the microarchitectural level and provide proof-of-concept integration of such modeling into a cycle-accurate simulator. This will allow analog side channels to become a first-class consideration, along with performance and power, in processor designs, allowing computer architects to avoid introducing significant new vulnerabilities and ``breaking'' existing software mitigation, and possibly even to reduce leakage and/or enable new mitigation. It would also allow programmers and even compilers to include analog side channel considerations in their tradeoff space during design and/or optimization.
\section{Broader Impacts}
We expect that our results will help include analog side channels among early-design considerations, which will help reduce the cost of side-channel resistant designs by addressing side-channel-related problems early in the design process, when side-channel resilience may be improved (or preserved) with little or no sacrifice in performance, power, cost, weight, etc. The proposed work is inherently interdisciplinary, combining expertise in computer architecture and circuits, hardware security, electromagnetic, and signal processing. Thus this research has the potential to improve the state of the art and have broader impacts in all these areas. Also, participating students will be working in a truly multidisciplinary context, which will broaden their expertise in ways that are otherwise not possible. The proposal also includes 1) developing an interactive demonstrator for the general public, to educate and raise awareness about several key cybersecurity concepts and issues, 2) visits and activities in local schools to improve K-12 education, and to  encourage participation of women and minorities in STEM, 3) course and curriculum development activities at the undergraduate and graduate level, and 4) activities to broaden participation in computing (as discussed in our BPC plan).
\section{Related Work}
There is a large body of work focused on preventing specific side-channel attacks, e.g., ~\cite{Backes:2010:ASA:1929820.1929847,Nazari:2017:EED:3079856.3080223,Demme:2013:FOM:2485922.2485970,Han:2017:WMB:3133956.3134081,Liu:2016:CET:2976749.2978299,6987331,He:2017:SYC:3123939.3124546,217605,Monjur21}, either by removing the tie between sensitive information and the side-channel signal, or by
trying to make the signal more difficult to measure, with less focus on the fundamental relationships between hardware, software, and side-channel signals.

Strategies for quantifying potential side channel exposure at the micro-architectural and architectural levels are still
an open problem. Existing work proposed different methods and/or metrics to estimate the leakage either for a specific type of side-channel (e.g., cache, power, EM, etc.) or, alternatively, as a generic framework to estimate the overall leakage for any given side-channel.

Side-Channel Vulnerability Factor (SVF)~\cite{Demme:2013:FOM:2485922.2485970} measures how the side-channel signal correlates with
high-level execution patterns (e.g., program phase transitions).
While this metric allows overall assessment of the
``leakiness'' of a particular system and application over a
given side-channel, it provides limited insight to 1) computer
architects about which architectural and microarchitectural
features are the strongest leakers, and to 2) software developers
about how to reduce the side-channel leakiness of their
code.

Signal Available to Attacker (SAVAT)~\cite{Callan:2014:PMM:2742155.2742179} measures the side-channel signal (particularly, EM and power from laptops) created by a specific single-instruction difference in program execution, i.e., the amount of signal made available
to a potential attacker who wishes to decide whether the program has executed instruction/event A or instruction/event B. These measurements can be used
to determine the potential for information leakage when
execution of individual instructions, or even sections of code,
depend on sensitive information. Unfortunately, SAVAT only models the system at the ISA level, ignoring the underlying relation of each instruction to the hardware or other instructions in the sequence. Extensions of SAVAT that include modeling instruction in a simple pipeline have also been proposed~\cite{baki17,Baki_2020a}.

McCann \textit{et al.}~\cite{McCann:2017:TPT:3241189.3241207} proposed a modeling technique capable of producing an instruction-level leakage metric for power and EM side-channel signals on ARM M0/M4 cores. To estimate the leakage for individual instructions, that method only requires knowledge about different ISA-level characteristics of the system, such as data-dependent effects of neighboring instructions in a sequence, register effects, bit-flips, etc. Similarly to SAVAT, the effects of micro-architecture events such as (cache miss, branch miss-prediction, etc.) are largely ignored.

Barenghi and Pelosi~\cite{Barenghi:2018:SSS:3195970.3196112} proposed a method that calculates leakage for individual instructions by measuring power consumption between two consecutive cycles and employs the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements. To calculate the leakage, in addition to leveraging  ISA-level information, a pipeline model was also used. However, the framework did not consider pipeline stalls or any other micro-architecture events, and did not model the individual effect of each stage on the others and the overall signal.

Another approach to quantifying side-channel leakage is to use information theory and estimate capacity of analog side channels. Millen was the first to establish a connection between Shannon's information theory and information flow models in computer systems~\cite{Millen87}, and to calculate the capacity (maximum possible data rate) of such a side-channel.
However, that model assumes a synchronous channel (where information is transmitted at a constant rate that is known to the receiver); this is not a realistic assumption for analog side-channels in computer systems, where the timing of execution in the spy program varies
due to a number of hardware features (e.g., pipeline stalls, dynamic scheduling of instructions, cache hits and misses, branch prediction, etc.).
Additionally, analog side-channels often include insertion, deletion, and errors, e.g., interrupts and other system activity often inserts activity into the timeline of the spy program's execution. 
While~\cite{baki18icassp,baki18milcom,baki17} derive bounds for information leakage from side-channels with insertions, deletions, and errors, but fall short of considering how executed instructions affect each other through their interaction with the microarchitecture,
and that can significantly impact the signal. Side-channel information capacity created by execution of a sequence of instructions was also derived by PIs Zajic and Prvulovic and their students~\cite{Baki_2020a}, using a Markov Source model to account for dependencies among instructions, treating a processor as a transmitter with multiple ``antennas'', where each antenna corresponds to a pipeline stage. While these capacity-based approaches can
represent the worst-case severity of side channel leakage, none of them provides enough detail to identify specific vulnerabilities and/or attribute leakage to specific hardware blocks or program code.

Another body of work related to this proposal are the cycle-accurate models/tools to simulate power and/or microarchitecture~\cite{Li:2009:MIP:1669112.1669172,Li:2011:CAM:2132325.2132479,509850,Ardestani:2013:EFM:2495252.2495480,Binkert:2011:GS:2024716.2024718,sesc,5982026,carlson2014aeohmcm}. While these models can accurately model the power consumption at each cycle, they are different from this work and hence may not be a proper tool for simulating analog side-channel signals for two main reasons: \textit{First}, while these methods do consider the activity factor to calculate power, they often treat all the bit-flips equally. However, as shown in \cite{Nader2020}, depending on the design, not all flips equally contribute to the overall signal. Ignoring this fact can lead to inaccurate modeling. \textit{Second}, depending on the architecture, different stages might have different effect on each other and the overall signal. Without properly modeling these effects, the overall signal can not be modeled.

The relationship between executed instructions, microarhitecture, and the resulting side-channel signals is also explored by work on leveraging EM signals for program profiling, tracking, and analysis~\cite{7783762,Gorman:2017:AON:3123939.3123973,Elvan2021,Zop, Zop2,Moumita2018,Moumita2022}. Spectral Profiling methods~\cite{7783762,Zop,Zop2,Elvan2021} track program execution at loop \cite{7783762}, basic-block \cite{Zop,Zop2}, or individual-instruction~\cite{Elvan2021} granularity.
\textsc{EMProf}~\cite{Moumita2018} profiles cache misses and \textsc{Primer}~\cite{Moumita2022} profiles interrupts, both leveraging electromagnetic (EM) emanations from devices. By continuously analyzing these EM emanations, \textsc{EMProf} identifies where in the signal's timeline each period of stalling begins and ends, allowing it to identify LLC miss events and to measure the actual performance impact of each such event (or overlapping group of events). Because \textsc{EMProf} is completely external to the profiled system, it does not change the behavior of the profiled system in any way, and requires no hardware support, no memory or other resources, and no instrumentation on the profiled system. Similarly, \textsc{Primer} analyzes the device's external EM side-channel signal in real-time, without any interference with the device's program execution, while providing a detailed analysis of not only the overall overhead created by interrupts, but also their distribution over time (i.e., exact occurrence of interrupts in program execution time-line). All these methods are complementary to this proposal and combined with proposed modeling tool can enhance leakage estimation, compiler development, etc.

\section{Proposed Outreach and Education Activities}

The proposed research work will help foster interaction among researchers from a
very diverse set of research areas and will involve training students
with a considerable multidisciplinary expertise. To further increase
the impact of this work, we are also planning to perform the following
outreach and education activities, as well as the activities described in our Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) plan.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]

\item We will continue to introduce relevant cross-disciplinary material into several courses at the graduate and undergraduate level.
For example, we will add to VLSI and computer architecture courses an introduction to physical side-channel signals.
Similarly, in electromagnetics, telecommunications, and signal processing classes, we will add a discussion of how computer
hardware and software interact to create side-channel signals. This will help students understand the broader perspectives relevant to
each class, and also help them appreciate the increasingly multi-disciplinary nature of science and technology.

\item We will continue to include undergraduate students in our research.
PIs Zajic and Prvulovic have long history of advising undergraduate students (26 undergrads)
through Opportunity Research Scholar (ORS) program at Georgia Tech and individual mentorship,
while PI Kumar has advised several undergraduate researchers who have gone on to join graduate
studies at UIUC and elsewhere, and has advised undergraduate students who have recently published
in premiere computer architecture conferences, including ISCA, HPCA (best paper nomination),
and DAC. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will help us engage a large number of undergraduate
students in research, and will provide both graduate and undergraduate student with a unique interdiciplinary skill-set.

\item Another outreach activity will be the development of displays
  and tools for educating the general public, especially high-school
  students and teachers, on issues related to side-channel signals.
  This initiative will be pursued through Georgia Tech’s established
  outreach programs for high schools in the greater metro Atlanta
  area~\cite{Conrad2022} and at events at UIUC.
  The PIs Zajic and Prvulovic have done this in the past with hands-on
  demonstration for the Family Science Night at the Mimosa Elementary
  School in Roswell, GA and hands-on STEM activities at Pace Academy
  in Atlanta, GA.
Similarly, Dr. Kumar has assisted in the organization of events such as
HackIllinois and Engineering Open House (EOH) that see enthusiastic
participation from the local community.
He will have a booth on “processors that leak information” in the next three EOHs to get high school students excited about intersection of computer architecture and security.

The PIs plan to conduct the proposed research, education, and outreach activities in a highly integrated manner, as the project requires technical and research expertise from several Computer Science (CS) and Electrical Engineering (EE) disciplines, and each PI brings skills essential for the success of this work. To keep the project integrated, we will regularly communicate among the team members, hold bi-weekly project-wide virtual meetings, and meet in person at least once per year (more details are in our Collaboration Plan).

\textit{Intellectual Merit:} The project has already resulted in first sub-cent microprocessor~cite{bleier22}, first plastic encryption engines~\cite{bleier23},
first work on printed microprocessors~\cite{bleier2020printed}, and first work on printed classifiers~\cite{mubarik20}.\\
\textit{Broader Impacts:} This project has opened up new possibilities for ultra-low cost and conformal active electronics, enabling applications such as wearable patches~\cite{8502791},
garments~\cite{garments}, packaging~\cite{gethin2013printed} for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), low-end healthcare products such as smart
bandages~\cite{DERAKHSHANDEH20181259}, and disposable sensors for food~\cite{7994325}, pharmaceuticals~\cite{BERGAMINI200554},
agriculture and forestry~\cite{chemosensors8040125}, and environment~\cite{MARRAZZA1999297} --- that have not seen much penetration of computing.
