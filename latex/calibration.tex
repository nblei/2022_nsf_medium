We have experience with not just digital design, but chip design,
tape-out, and testing, and run an undergraudate course in which student designs
are manufactured by TSMC and then tested on campus.  We also participate
in Intel's Chip Design Challenge, manufacturing RISC-V microprocessors in Intel
16 nm technology. This provides the PIs a sizeable collection of
microprocessors with various microarchitectures which can be profiled at
multiple levels of abstraction - high-level microarchitecture, RTL, gate-level,
GDS/geometry level, and physical chips. This allows the PIs to evaluate the
predictive accuracy of the model described in
Section~\ref{sec:preliminary_results} when modified for other ISAs and
microarchitectures, and calibrate the model builder based on real-world designs
and implementations.
