	abstract="It is well known that constant-time implementations of modular exponentiation cannot use sliding windows. However, software libraries such as Libgcrypt, used by GnuPG, continue to use sliding windows. It is widely believed that, even if the complete pattern of squarings and multiplications is observed through a side-channel attack, the number of exponent bits leaked is not sufficient to carry out a full key-recovery attack against RSA. Specifically, 4-bit sliding windows leak only 40{\%} of the bits, and 5-bit sliding windows leak only 33{\%} of the bits.",

abstract = {A large number of emerging applications such as implantables, wearables, printed electronics, and IoT have ultra-low area and power constraints. These applications rely on ultra-low-power general purpose microcontrollers and microprocessors, making them the most abundant type of processor produced and used today. While general purpose processors have several advantages, such as amortized development cost across many applications, they are significantly over-provisioned for many area- and power-constrained systems, which tend to run only one or a small number of applications over their lifetime. In this paper, we make a case for bespoke processor design, an automated approach that tailors a general purpose processor IP to a target application by removing all gates from the design that can never be used by the application. Since removed gates are never used by an application, bespoke processors can achieve significantly lower area and power than their general purpose counterparts without any performance degradation. Also, gate removal can expose additional timing slack that can be exploited to increase area and power savings or performance of a bespoke design. Bespoke processor design reduces area and power by 62% and 50%, on average, while exploiting exposed timing slack improves average power savings to 65%.},

abstract = {The growing movement to connect literally everything to the internet (internet of things or IoT) through ultra-low-power embedded microprocessors poses a critical challenge for information security. Gate-level tracking of information flows has been proposed to guarantee information flow security in computer systems. However, such solutions rely on non-commodity, secure-by-design processors. In this work, we observe that the need for secure-by-design processors arises because previous works on gate-level information flow tracking assume no knowledge of the application running in a system. Since IoT systems typically run a single application over and over for the lifetime of the system, we see a unique opportunity to provide application-specific gate-level information flow security for IoT systems. We develop a gate-level symbolic analysis framework that uses knowledge of the application running in a system to efficiently identify all possible information flow security vulnerabilities for the system. We leverage this information to provide security guarantees on commodity processors. We also show that security vulnerabilities identified by our analysis framework can be eliminated through software modifications at 15\% energy overhead, on average, obviating the need for secure-by-design hardware. Our framework also allows us to identify and eliminate only the vulnerabilities that an application is prone to, reducing the cost of information flow security by 3.3\texttimes{} compared to a software-based approach that assumes no application knowledge.},

abstract = {Flexible electronics is a promising approach to target applications whose computational needs are not met by traditional silicon-based electronics due to their conformality, thinness, or cost requirements. A microprocessor is a critical component for many such applications; however, it is unclear whether it is feasible to build flexible processors at scale (i.e., at high yield), since very few flexible microprocessors have been reported and no yield data or data from multiple chips has been reported. Also, prior manufactured flexible systems were not field-reprogrammable and were evaluated either on a simple set of test vectors or a single program. A working flexible microprocessor chip supporting complex or multiple applications has not been demonstrated. Finally, no prior work performs a design space of flexible microprocessors to optimize area, code size, and energy of such microprocessors.In this work, we fabricate and test hundreds of FlexiCores - flexible 0.8 μm IGZO TFT-based field-reprogrammable 4 and 8-bit microprocessor chips optimized for low footprint and yield. We show that these gate count-optimized processors can have high yield (4-bit FlexiCores have 81\% yield - sufficient to enable sub-cent cost if produced at volume). We evaluate these chips over a suite of representative kernels - the kernels take 4.28 ms to 12.9 ms and 21.0 μJ to 61.4 μJ for execution (at 360 nJ per instruction). We also present the first characterization of process variation for a flexible processor - we observe significant process variation (relative standard deviation of 15.3\% and 21.5\% in terms of current draw of 4-bit and 8-bit FlexiCore chips respectively). Finally, we perform a design space exploration and identify design points much better than FlexiCores - the new cores consume only 45--56\% the energy of the base design, and have code size less than 30\% of the base design, with an area overhead of 9--37\%.},

Although chronic wounds are locked in a persisting inflamed state, they are dynamic and proper therapy requires identifying abnormalities, administering proper drugs and growth factors, and modulating the conditions of the environment. In this review article, we discuss technologies that have been developed to actively monitor the wound environment. We also highlight drug delivery tools that have been integrated with bandages to facilitate precise temporal and spatial control over drug release and review automated or semi-automated systems that can respond to the wound environment.}

The present work presents a proposal for the application of a gold screen-printed electrode an electrochemical sensor for monitoring l-dopa in stationary solution and a flow system. Using the electrooxidation of l-dopa at +0.63V in acetate buffer pH 3.0 on a gold screen-printed electrode it is possible to obtain a linear calibration curve from 9.9×10−5 to 1.2×10−3molL−1 and a detection limit of 6.8×10−5molL−1. Under amperometric conditions (Eapp=0.8V; flow rate=14.1mLmin−1; pH 3.0), an analytical calibration graph for l-dopa was obtained from 1.0×10−6molL−1 6.6×10−4molL−1 with a detection limit of 9.9×10−7molL−1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of l-dopa in commercial dosage forms without any pre-treatment.}

ABSTRACT = {Digitization of industrial processes using new technologies (IoT&mdash;Internet of Things, IoE&mdash;Internet of Everything), including the agriculture industry, are globally gaining growing interest. The precise management of production inputs is essential for many agricultural companies because limited or expensive sources of water and nutrients could make sustainable production difficult. For these reasons, precise data from fields, plants, and greenhouses have become more important for decision making and for the proper dosage of water and nutrients. On the market are a variety of sensors for monitoring environmental parameters within a precise agricultural area. However, the high price, data storage/transfer functionality are limiting so cost-effective products capable to transfer data directly to farmers via wireless IoT networks are required. Within a given scope, low-price sensor elements with an appropriate level of sensor response are required. In the presented paper, we have developed fully printed sensor elements and a dedicated measuring/communicating unit for IoT monitoring of soil moisture. Various fabrication printing techniques and a variety of materials were used. From the performed study, it is obvious that fully printed sensor elements based on cheap and environmentally friendly carbon layers printed on the wood substrate can compete with conventionally made sensors based on copper.},

abstract = {Two disposable electrochemical biosensors are described; the first one is useful for the detection of the hybridization of DNA and the second one is able to detect low-molecular weight compounds (toxins, pollutants, drugs) with affinity for nucleic acids. Synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides have been immobilized onto graphite screen-printed electrodes using adsorption at a controlled potential. The probes were hybridized with different concentrations of the complementary sequences. The hybrids formed on the electrode surface were evaluated by chronopotentiometric stripping analysis using daunomycin hydrochloride as an indicator of the hybridization reaction. The DNA sensor was able to detect 0.2mgl−1 of a 21-base target sequence. The determination of low-molecular weight compounds with affinity for DNA was measured by their effect on the oxidation signal of the guanine peak of calf thymus immobilized on the electrode sensor and investigated by chronopotentiometric analysis. The DNA biosensor is able to detect known intercalating and groove binding compounds. Detection limits of 0.3, 0.2 and 10mgl−1 were obtained for daunomycin, polychlororinated biphenyls (PCBs) and aflatoxin B1, respectively. Applicability to river water samples was demonstrated.}
